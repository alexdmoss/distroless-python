# distroless-python

Creates a distroless container image with up-to-date python installed

---

## Usage

No `latest` tag is offered. The intent is to be intentional (!) in your choice of version and when to upgrade.

### python/distroless

In general, you're going to want this:

```dockerfile
FROM mosstech/python-distroless:3.9-debian11
```

A debug image also exists:

```sh
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint=sh mosstech/python-distroless:3.9-debian11-debug
```

There are variants for Python 3.9 and Python 3.10, both based on Debian 11. They are built from the `python:3.x-slim-bullseye` image base.

> Note: Scripts in this repo will build for Apple Silicon (`-arm64` is appended to the tag), but the CI has not currently been adapted to offer this, so you'll need to build and push locally

### python/builder

For convenience, the `builder` image used to create the above is also published. This is **not** in general going to be useful in running python apps, but can be a convenient way to get a top layer that is `python:3.9-slim-bullseye` but with a non-root user and virtualenv/pipenv/poetry pre-installed - fewer stuff for you to sort in your Dockerfile!

To use it:

```dockerfile
FROM mosstech/python-builder:3.9-debian11
```

## Upgrading

Python and OS version are set in `.gitlab-ci.yml`. This repo originates at [https://gitlab.com/alexos-dev/distroless-python](https://gitlab.com/alexos-dev/distroless-python) but is mirrored to Github [https://github.com/alexdmoss/distroless-python](https://github.com/alexdmoss/distroless-python) for convenience in sharing. Perhaps I'll convert to use Github actions at some point ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Rationale

1. Variants based on Debian (e.g. `python:*-slim-bullseye`) often have a number of vulnerabilities in them. Debian take their time responding and deal with many, and whilst this is quite often for very justifiable reasons, it is pretty toilsome work to reason about the risk and patch or suppress as needed.
2. Alpine would be my normal go-to here but that experience with Python is grim. I believe it all stems from its use of `musl` rather than `glibc` as its standard C library. Python wheels exist for the latter (so builds are much faster) and the two are not perfectly interoperable (i.e. there are potentially subtle bugs or performance differences). [This excellent blog post](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/alpine-docker-python/) elaborates on this.
3. The Google Distroless image for Python is marked as experimental and has been for a while, and tied to what Debian ships with - i.e. an old copy of python and dependent libraries. In other words it does not really solve for the problem statement in (1), and comes with several of its own.

## Implementation

Following issues copying the Bazel-based approach used by [Google's distroless repo itself](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless), I switched approach to a technique I understood better - multi-layer docker images. I took the distroless C image as a base and then used an earlier docker layer to bring in my choice of Python + its dependencies in.

### A Note on M1 / Apple Silicon

The scripts can be used locally to build an `-arm64` variant, but the CI will currently only build the x86_64 version. I haven't yet looked into options to deal with this yet.
